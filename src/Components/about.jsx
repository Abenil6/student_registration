          Haramaya University (HU) is one of the oldest higher learning institutions in Ethiopia which has gone through 
          more than six decades of gigantic transformations since its establishment as an Imperial Ethiopian College of Agricultural and Mechanical of Arts (IECAMA) in the early 1950s. 
          Its foundation was necessitated with the need for modernizing and advancing Ethiopiaâ€™s agriculture through the production of trained manpower and pragmatic research and extension programs.
